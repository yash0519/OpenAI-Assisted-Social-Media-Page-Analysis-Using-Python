# Project Report  
## OpenAI-Assisted Social Media Page Analysis Using Python

---

## 1. Introduction
Social media platforms generate vast amounts of data related to users,
creators, communities, and engagement. Analyzing this data helps in
understanding trends, influence, and content focus.

This project performs a structured analysis of social media page data using
Python, with OpenAI used as a supporting tool for interpretation and
documentation clarity.

---

## 2. Problem Statement
Given raw social media page data, the objectives of this project are:
- To clean and structure the dataset
- To analyze engagement metrics such as followers and posting frequency
- To categorize pages based on their type and content
- To extract insights from descriptive bio text

---

## 3. Data Understanding
Each data entry contains:
- Identity information (username, name)
- Engagement metrics (followers, following, posts)
- Page category (e.g., Engineer, Media, Community)
- Bio text describing the page’s focus or activity

The dataset reflects realistic and diverse social media behavior.

---

## 4. Data Cleaning and Preparation
The following preparation steps were applied:
- Standardizing field names
- Ensuring numerical consistency for engagement metrics
- Structuring text fields for readability and analysis
- Storing cleaned data for repeated analysis

These steps ensured the dataset was suitable for systematic exploration.

---

## 5. Exploratory Analysis
The analysis focused on:
- Identifying pages with high follower counts
- Comparing engagement across different page categories
- Observing relationships between posting frequency and followers
- Exploring bio content to understand thematic focus

The analysis helped reveal how different types of pages engage their audience.

---

## 6. Use of OpenAI
OpenAI was used to:
- Assist in interpreting analytical results
- Improve explanation quality
- Help structure findings into clear documentation

No automated decision-making or model training was performed using OpenAI.

---

## 7. Limitations
- The analysis is descriptive, not predictive
- No machine learning models are used
- Results depend on the available attributes in the dataset

These limitations are intentional to maintain analytical clarity.

---

## 8. Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability to:
- Work with raw social media datasets
- Perform structured exploratory analysis using Python
- Interpret engagement patterns meaningfully
- Use OpenAI responsibly as an analytical assistant

It represents a solid personal data analysis project suitable for Python and
data-focused roles.
